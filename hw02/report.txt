3) When the end element for text is reached, add it to an arraylist (questions). 
When the end element for choice is reached, and when the number of choices are divisible by 4, push the question and 
the correct choice along with the question into a map with the Question as the key and push the question and
the last 4 choices in the choices arraylist into another map with question as the key again.

6) As soon as a choice is selected from the response activity, the user is redirected to the MainActivity using an
Intent which stores what color to choose for the question in the list in the MainActivity. This color is set
by getting the correct choice for the current question from the map which is defined in the Question class.
Every time when a question is clicked, I get the background of the TextView in the ListView. If it is null, then
start the ResponseActivity or else don't start it. This way, if there is an answered question, it tries to get the
background which is not null. So no further action will be taken.
